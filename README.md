# IBM Data Science

## What is Data Science? (Week 1 - 2022/12/18) 

1. Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.

2. Data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.

3. a little science + a little math + a lot of curiosity about data -> data science .

**The sexiest job in the 21st century! (Do you really believe this haha?)**

## What do Data Science do? (Week 1 - 2022/12/19)

1. Data Scientist: someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing Big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders. 

2. The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.

3. Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. [Table(excel) -> structured data; From web(text, audio or video) -> unstructured data]

4. Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the **Cloud** enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.


## Big Data and Data Mining (Week 2 - 2022/12/20)

### Foundations of Big Data
1. **Big Data:** Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value. -by Ernst and Young

2. **The V's of Big Data**
    - Velocity: the speed at which data accumulates  
    - Volume: the scale of the data, or the increase in the amount of data stored
    - Variety: the diversity of the data
    - Veracity: the quality and origin of data, and its conformity to facts and accuracy
    - Value: the ability and need to turn data into value. 

### What is Hadoop?
Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data. Instead of using one large computer to store and process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly.

### How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation?
1. **Digital Transformation:** 
    - it affects business operations, updating existing processes and operations and creating new ones to harness the benefits of new technologies. This digital change integrates digital technology into all areas of an organization resulting in fundamental changes to how it operates and delivers value to customers.    

    - It is not simply duplicating existing processes in digital form; the in-depth analysis of how the business operates helps organizations discover how to improve their processes and operations, and harness the benefits of integrating data science into their workflows. Most organizations realize that digital transformation will require fundamental changes to their approach towards data, employees, and customers, and it will affect their organizational culture. 

### Summary
In this lesson, you have learned:

1. How Big Data is defined by the Vs: Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value.

2. How Hadoop and other tools, combined with distributed computing power,  are used to handle the demands of Big Data.  

3. What skills are required to analyse Big Data. 

4. About [the process of Data Mining](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/Data_Mining.md.html?origin=www.coursera.org), and how it produces results.
