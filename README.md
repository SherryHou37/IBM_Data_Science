## What is Data Science? (Week 1 - 2022/12/18) 

1. Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.

2. Data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.

3. a little science + a little math + a lot of curiosity about data -> data science .

**The sexiest job in the 21st century! (Do you really believe this haha?)**

## What do Data Science do? (Week 1 - 2022/12/19)

1. Data Scientist: someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing Big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders. 

2. The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.

3. Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. [Table(excel) -> structured data; From web(text, audio or video) -> unstructured data]

4. Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the **Cloud** enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.


## Big Data and Data Mining (Week 2 - 2022/12/20)

### Foundations of Big Data
1. **Big Data:** Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value. -by Ernst and Young

2. **The V's of Big Data**
    - Velocity: the speed at which data accumulates  
    - Volume: the scale of the data, or the increase in the amount of data stored
    - Variety: the diversity of the data
    - Veracity: the quality and origin of data, and its conformity to facts and accuracy
    - Value: the ability and need to turn data into value. 

### What is Hadoop?
Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data. Instead of using one large computer to store and process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly.

### How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation?
1. **Digital Transformation:** 
    - it affects business operations, updating existing processes and operations and creating new ones to harness the benefits of new technologies. This digital change integrates digital technology into all areas of an organization resulting in fundamental changes to how it operates and delivers value to customers.    

    - It is not simply duplicating existing processes in digital form; the in-depth analysis of how the business operates helps organizations discover how to improve their processes and operations, and harness the benefits of integrating data science into their workflows. Most organizations realize that digital transformation will require fundamental changes to their approach towards data, employees, and customers, and it will affect their organizational culture. 

### Summary
In this lesson, you have learned:

1. How Big Data is defined by the Vs: Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value.

2. How Hadoop and other tools, combined with distributed computing power,  are used to handle the demands of Big Data.  

3. What skills are required to analyse Big Data. 

4. About [the process of Data Mining](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/Data_Mining.md.html?origin=www.coursera.org), and how it produces results. 

## Deep Learning and Machine Learning (Week 2 - 2022/12/21)

### What's the difference between these key words?

|   Big Data    |  Data Mining          | Machine Learning  | Deep Learning | Artificial Intelligence | Data Science |
| ------------- | -------------| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
|  Data sets that are so massive, so quickly built, and so varied that they defy traditional analysis methods such as you might perform with a relational database.  | Data mining is the process of automatically searching and analyzing data, discovering previously unrevealed patterns. It involves preprocessing the data to prepare it and transforming it into an appropriate format. | Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it is learned without being explicitly programmed. | Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making. | Data Science is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data. It's an interdisciplinary field involving mathematics, statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more. | AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions. |
| The five V's; velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value. | Once this is done, insights and patterns are mined and extracted using various tools and techniques ranging from simple data visualization tools to machine learning and statistical models. |  Machine learning algorithms are trained with large sets of data and they learn from examples. They do not follow rules-based algorithms. Machine learning is what enables machines to solve problems on their own and make accurate predictions using the provided data. | Deep learning algorithms can label and categorize information and identify patterns. It is what enables AI systems to continuously learn on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results by determining whether decisions were correct. | It's what makes it possible for us to appropriate information, see patterns, find meaning from large volumes of data and use it to make decisions that drive business. Data Science can use many of the AI techniques to derive insight from data. For example, it could use machine learning algorithms and even deep learning models to extract meaning and draw inferences from data. |  Both AI and Data Science can involve the use of big data. That is, significantly large volumes of data. |
| | | |  Artificial neural networks, often referred to simply as neural networks, take inspiration from biological neural networks, although they work quite a bit differently. A neural network in AI is a collection of small computing units called neurons that take incoming data and learn to make decisions over time. |

**There is some interaction between AI and Data Science, but one is not a subset of the other. Rather, Data Science is a broad term that encompasses the entire data processing methodology while AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions. Both AI and Data Science can involve the use of big data. That is, significantly large volumes of data.**

### [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks)

![key-terms](image/key-terms.png)

1. Neural networks—and more specifically, artificial neural networks (ANNs)—mimic the human brain through a set of algorithms. At a basic level, a neural network is comprised of four main components: inputs, weights, a bias or threshold, and an output. Similar to linear regression, the algebraic formula would look something like this:

![formula](image/formula.png)

2.  The “deep” in deep learning is referring to the **depth of layers in a neural network.** A neural network that consists of **more than three layers, which would be inclusive of the inputs and the output** —can be considered a deep learning algorithm. This is generally represented using the following diagram:

### Summary

1. The differences between some common Data Science terms, including Deep Learning and Machine Learning.

2. Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that simulates human decision-making using neural networks.

## Data Science in Business (Week 3 - 2022/12/22)

### Summary

1. Data Science helps physicians provide the best treatment for their patients, and helps meteorologists predict the extent of local weather events, and can even help predict natural disasters like earthquakes and tornadoes.

2. That companies can start on their data science journey by capturing data. Once they have data, they can begin analysing it.

3. Some ways that data is generated by consumers. 

4. How businesses like Netflix, Amazon, UPs, Google, and Apple use the data generated by their consumers and employees.

5. The purpose of the final deliverable of a Data Science project is to communicate new information and insights from the data analysis to key decision-makers.
